Asteroids Reimagined Beta 4.24.00 released.

Instructions:
AWD to rotate and move. Use mouse to aim turret. Right mouse for shield. Left mouse to fire. Gun heats up as you fire, and slowly cools when you're not. Using shield drains its power, and slowly regains when not in use. E or Middle Mouse button for secondary weapon (Red, Yellow, Orange and Violet.) Mouse Wheel to switch type if you have more than one.

Power ups, blue one boost your shields, red ones give your gun cool boost, they are both cumulative. Purple is a super power up that keeps the shield on, and gun cool, and is timed. Red is the Big Shot you get a limited number. Yellow is Double Shot, you get a limed number. Orange is Homing Mine, they seek out enemy ships, you get a limited number. Violet is Plasma Shot, it grows as it goes, destroying everything in its path. Ends at edge of screen.

Enter key is now used for Forced Spawn when player is waiting for rocks to clear spawn area.

Game also has controller support.

Made with raylib and my Knightmare arcade engine in C++.

Bug Fixes:
Player homing mine went to center of screen when Death Star or fighters active. Fixed.

Changes:
When UFO hits rock, 5 to number of rocks by wave spawn if not a small rock.
After every five waves, more than one more rocks spawn at the start of the wave. That number increases every five waves.
Player shot (Turret and secondary) now effected by ship velocity.
Big Shot now takes out multiple rocks(5), enemies(2).
Player can change active secondary weapon if they have more than one.

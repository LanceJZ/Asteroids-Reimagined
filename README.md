Asteroids Reimagined Alpha 4.22.2 released.
Power ups, blue one boost your shields, red ones give your gun cool boost, they are both cumulative. Purple is a super power up that keeps the shield on, and gun cool, and is timed. Red is the Big Shot you get a limited number. Yellow is Double Shot, you get a limed number. Orange is Homing Mine, they seek out enemy ships, you get a limited number. Violet is Plasma Shot, it grows as it goes, destroying everything in its path.

AWD to rotate and move. Use mouse to aim turret. Right mouse for shield. Left mouse to fire. Gun heats up as you fire, and slowly cools when you're not. Using shield drains its power, and slowly regains when not in use. E for secondary weapon (Red, Yellow, Orange and Violet.)

Enter key is now used for Forced Spawn when player is waiting for rocks to clear spawn area.

Game also has controller support.
